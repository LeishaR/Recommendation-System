# Recommendation-System
In this project, a user-based collaborative filtering recommender system is implemented
using cosine similarity. The dataset comprises movie ratings from users, which are used to
create a user-item matrix. Cosine similarity measures the similarity between the new user
and existing users based on their rating patterns. The predicted ratings for the new user are
then calculated using weighted averages of the user-item matrix, and the top-k movie
recommendations are presented.
